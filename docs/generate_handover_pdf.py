Generate the handover PDF for CyberScore.

The PDF has two parts:
  1. Final Report: a complete written walkthrough of the project.
  2. Presentation Slides Outline: 6 slides with what goes on each one.

Both parts are written in plain, slightly formal English from Saanvi's
first person voice. There are deliberately no em-dashes anywhere in
the content per the requested style.

        "areas are weak, and offers personalised suggestions. There is also a built in chat "
