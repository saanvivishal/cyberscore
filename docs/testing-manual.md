# Manual Test Plan

A scripted set of manual tests to run before each release. Substitute for the automated test suite that hasn't been written yet.

> The next batch should replace this document with `*.test.ts` files. Manual testing is slow, flaky, and doesn't run on CI. But until tests exist, **this is the verification gate before a release.**

---

## When to run this

- Before tagging a new version
- Before sending a deployment URL to the supervisor / a user
- After any change to `lib/auth`, `lib/scorecard`, `lib/access`, or the mobile auth screens
- After a database migration
- After changing the email send code path

---

## Setup

You'll need:

1. **Local dev environment** running:
   ```bash
 # Terminal 1, API
   npm run dev --workspace @cyberscore/api
   
 # Terminal 2, Mobile (Metro)
   EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://$(ipconfig getifaddr en0):3000 \
     npm run start --workspace @cyberscore/mobile
   ```
   *(Skip the worker terminal, emails are inline now.)*

2. **Or the live production deployment** at https://cyberscore-api.vercel.app, when testing the deployed APK or doing pre-handover smoke tests.

3. **A clean database** (if testing the register flow). Recreate with:
   ```bash
   cd apps/api && npx prisma migrate reset --force && npm run db:seed
   ```

## Verifying the live deployment

Quick checks against `https://cyberscore-api.vercel.app` to confirm the production endpoint is healthy:

### Health check

```bash
curl -s https://cyberscore-api.vercel.app/api/v1/health | jq
```

Expected:
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "uptimeMs": <some-large-number>,
  "latencyMs": { "database": <50-200>, "redis": <30-100> },
  "checks": { "database": "ok", "redis": "ok" }
}
```

### Login

```bash
curl -s -X POST 'https://cyberscore-api.vercel.app/api/v1/auth/login' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"saanvi.vishal@iiitb.ac.in","password":"cyberscore-demo-2026"}' \
  | jq '.user.email, .org.orgName'
```

Expected output:
```
"saanvi.vishal@iiitb.ac.in"
"IIIT Bangalore"
```

### Password reset OTP send

```bash
curl -s -X POST 'https://cyberscore-api.vercel.app/api/v1/auth/password-reset/request' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"saanvi.vishal@iiitb.ac.in"}' \
  -w '\n--- HTTP %{http_code} ---\n'
```

Expected:
```json
{"ok":true,"otpSent":true}
--- HTTP 200 ---
```

Then verify the email arrives in the IIITB inbox.

### Brevo log inspection (sanity check)

```bash
curl -s 'https://api.brevo.com/v3/smtp/emails?email=saanvi.vishal@iiitb.ac.in&limit=3' \
  -H 'api-key: <BREVO_API_KEY>' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  | python3 -m json.tool
```

Should show recent sends from the API with `"subject": "Your CyberScore verification code"`.

## What's NOT covered by manual testing

- Race conditions (two users submitting the same KPI simultaneously)
- Concurrent assessment progress saves
- Edge cases in scoring (KPI with 0 weight, all-tier-1 responses)
- Memory leaks on long-running sessions
- Performance under load (1000+ concurrent users)

The next batch should write automated tests for these.

---

## When a manual test fails

1. **Capture:**
   - Screenshot of the broken screen
   - Network tab from Chrome dev tools (or React Native debugger) showing the failing request
   - API server logs from the same timestamp

2. **File:**
   - Open a GitHub issue with title `Bug: <one-line summary>`
   - Body: steps to reproduce, expected vs actual, screenshots, log excerpts
   - Label: `bug`

3. **Block:**
   - If a smoke-test step fails, block the release until fixed
   - If a regression-test step fails but smoke tests pass, document in `docs/known-issues.md` and decide whether to ship anyway
